I created this app using NodeJS, ReactJS, and the weather API provided by https://www.apixu.com/. Hosted at this address: http://shanes-react-weather-app.herokuapp.com/. I am proud to say that this is the first ReactJS project I have completed on my own. This project was created to show myself, along with potential employers, that I have gained knowledge in important technologies needed by today's web development industry.
